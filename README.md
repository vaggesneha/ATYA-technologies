 Internship Learnings Summary

During my one-month internship at "Atya Technologies Pvt. Ltd.", I gained hands-on experience across multiple domains within embedded systems and IoT development. The program offered a blend of hardware design, sensor experimentation, and data-driven visualizationâ€”providing a strong foundation for real-world applications.

1. PCB Design with KiCad
- Designed schematics and PCB layouts using 'KiCad'
- Worked on routing, footprint creation, and multi-layer board design
- Learned the complete cycle from concept to simulation and fabrication-ready files

2. Sensor Integration
- Explored "basic, intermediate, and advanced sensors" using provided modules
- Implemented Arduino-based sensor logic, covering data capture, calibration, and control
- Gained insight into performance metrics and real-world behavior of components

3. Node-RED Visualization
- Connected embedded systems to "Node-RED" workflows for real-time monitoring
- Created responsive dashboards to track sensor activity and system performance
- Understood data flow, logic nodes, and automation triggers in IoT environments


This immersive experience helped me bridge the gap between hardware-level engineering and intelligent system visualization, preparing me to build scalable, interactive IoT solutions.
